### To get started:
- Run `npm install`
##### Development
- Run `npm run dev` to start webpack-dev-server. Electron will launch automatically after compilation.
##### Production

- Run `npm run package` to have webpack compile your application into `dist/bundle.js` and `dist/index.html`, and then an electron-packager run will be triggered for the current platform/arch, outputting to `builds/`
